9/9:
  -added several lists containing different responses to the users input.
  -used the random libary to select something for the bot to say.
  -let the user be able to respond to the bot.
  -added if statements to help lead the bot with the flow of the conversation and personlize comments
  -ran into the issue that the if statments were desined to check an int while the varible contained a string.
-resoveled issue stated above by making the random selection code choose a random number inbetween the index of the string and then pulling it, instead of pulling it straight from the string. this solved the issue because this allowed for the varible to contain an intiger instead of a string, making the if statment valid.
-problem is resolved code is resolved
-added a option for user to ask the bot a yes or no question, as of this moment responses are random.

9/13:
  -removed name as a random option, added it to always ask for name.
